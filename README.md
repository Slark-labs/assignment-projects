# 📝 Assignment Projects Repository

Welcome to the **Assignment Projects** repository! This is the central hub for all trainee assignments in our organization. Each trainee will have the opportunity to work on various assignments and challenges here to build their skills and track their learning journey.

## 📂 Repository Overview

This repository is organized with **one main branch** (the `main` branch) and separate **branches for each assignment**. Here’s how it works:

- The `main` branch hosts this `README.md` file and any essential guidelines.
- Each assignment will have its own branch, with the branch name indicating the assignment title or number.
- New assignments will be added as separate branches so trainees can work on them in isolation and submit them for review independently.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org-name/assignment-projects.git
