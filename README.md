- **Key Concepts**: Background properties, image styling, text alignment, and using the `background-attachment: fixed` property for a parallax effect.

### Skills Section

- **Purpose**: Display a list of your skills with descriptions. Each skill is placed in a card-style container.
- **Key Concepts**: Grid layout for responsiveness, hover effects, and card styling.

### Portfolio Section

- **Key Concepts**: Blockquote element for quotes, pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`) for decorative quotes, and text styling.

## Responsive Design

This website is fully responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors. The layout adjusts dynamically using:

- **CSS Grid**: Used for arranging items in a flexible and responsive manner.
- **Flexbox**: Ensures elements are aligned correctly in both horizontal and vertical directions.
- **Media Queries**: Used to modify styles at different breakpoints (screen sizes) for improved user experience on smaller screens.

### Example Media Query

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .navbar ul {
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 1rem;
  }
  .portfolio-container {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}
```

## Instructions

1. **Understanding the CSS Code**:
   - The CSS code includes styles for different sections such as Hero, Skills, Portfolio, Testimonials, and Contact.
   - **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid** are used for layout management.
   - **Hover Effects** are applied to buttons, links, and portfolio items to make the design interactive.
   - **Transitions** are used for smooth visual effects, such as scaling elements on hover.
   - **Responsive Design** is ensured by using **media queries** to adapt the layout for mobile and tablet screens.

2. **Adding Your Own Content**:
   - In `index.html`, replace the placeholder text and images with your own personal details, such as:
     - Your name, job title, and description in the Hero section.

     - Your projects in the Portfolio section.
     - Testimonials from people who have worked with you.
     - Your contact information and a contact form.

3. **Customization**:
   - Customize colors, fonts, and layout by editing the `style.css` file.
   - Use the provided CSS properties to make the design more personal, e.g., changing the background images, button colors, or font family.

4. **Deploying the Website**:
